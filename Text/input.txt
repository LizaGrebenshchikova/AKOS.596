Those who live in the country like to go to a big city and spend their time visiting museums and
 art galleries, looking at shop windows and dining at exotic restaurants. City residents usually
 like a quiet holiday by the sea and in the mountains with nothing to do but walk and bathe and
 lay in the sun. Most travelers and holiday-makers take a camera with them and take pictures of
 everything that interest them - the sights of a city, old churches and castles, views of
 mountains, lakes, valleys, plains, waterfalls, forests, different kinds of trees, flowers and
 plants, animals and birds. Later, perhaps years later, they will be reminded by the photos of the
 happy time they had.
